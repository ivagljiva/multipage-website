      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Several of my course projects have been relevant to my research interests in genomics
        and computational science. I've used every academic opportunity to gain experience or
        knowledge that will help me in my research. For instance, I'm hoping to apply the machine
        learning and data science skills I learned in CS classes to future genome analysis projects.
        Recently, I participated in the Student Cluster Competition at SC17 to learn more about
        high-performance computing, particularly in the context of scientific applications. I'll be
        able to adapt the genomics software I write to HPC settings because of this experience.

      <p>
        I attended the Student Cluster Competition at SC17, as part of the Illinois Institute of
        Technology team. We spent several months preparing for the competition by selecting and
        setting up our cluster hardware and software, profiling the competition applications, and
        studying the science behind each application. Due to my genomics background, I was the team
        member responsible for MrBayes, a software for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We finished
        as the 6th place team (out of 16).
